This project implements a scalable, modular thread management library in C,
capable of handling thousands of tasks using an efficient thread pool design.

The library includes:
- Core thread wrappers (creation, join, detach, exit)
- Synchronization primitives (mutex + condition variable abstractions)
- A scalable thread pool with task queue
- Example programs and stress tests
